# Spotify-Clone: Swatify
With the assistance of a course through Udemy, I have created a clone web application of one of my favorite music streaming services... Spotify, or as I call it Swatify!

This web application was created using a variety of HTML elements and styling along with a good amount of Javascript, PHP, jquery, and ajax calls.
The web app runs off an apache server through xampp, with a MySQL database running in the back-end. The application is fully functional and can do most of the things
Spotify can do like playing songs, creating/deleting playlists and adding/removing songs from them.

The course I used as a guide was taught by Reece Kenney who is a current Software Engineer at Microsoft and can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/spotify-clone/)!
